Coin Change Problem using Dynamic Programming

The coin change problem has several variations:
1. Minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount
2. Number of ways to make a given amount using given coins
3. All possible combinations to make a given amount

Problem: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum
number of coins needed to make that amount, or count the number of ways to make it.

Time Complexity: O(n*amount) where n is the number of coin denominations
Space Complexity: O(n*amount) for the DP table
