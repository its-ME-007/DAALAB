"""
0/1 Knapsack Problem using Dynamic Programming

The 0/1 knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where we have:
- A set of items, each with a weight and value
- A knapsack with a maximum weight capacity
- Goal: Maximize the total value while staying within the weight limit
- Constraint: Each item can only be used once (0/1 decision)

Time Complexity: O(n*W) where n is number of items and W is knapsack capacity
Space Complexity: O(n*W) for the DP table
